Task:
Review the policies extracted by the creator node and ensure they meet the quality and relevance criteria. Revise the list by removing irrelevant policies and adding missing ones if needed.

Instructions:

Remove policies that:
Are too general (apply to all tools, not just ToolX).
Cannot be validated before invoking ToolX.
Are not actionable (i.e., cannot be enforced using ToolX’s parameters, chat history, or data access).
Ensure policies are self-contained, meaning:
The description includes all necessary information without needing external context.
References are exact copies of the original policy document.
Add missing policies that should be validated before calling ToolX.
Provide a global review score (1-5) based on the quality of the creator's output.
