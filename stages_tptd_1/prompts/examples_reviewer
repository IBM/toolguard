Objective:
Your task is to review the violating and compliance examples provided for each policy. Based on your review, you will write comments on the quality and completeness of the examples and provide a global score (1 to 5) assessing how well the examples cover the policies.

Review Criteria:
1. Coverage:
Do the examples cover all relevant scenarios, including common cases, edge cases, and variations?
Are all possible ways of violating the policy represented?
Are all correct ways to comply with the policy included?

2. Clarity:
Is each example easy to understand?
Does each violating example clearly demonstrate why the policy is violated?
Does each compliance example clearly demonstrate why the policy is followed?

3. Actionability:
Can the examples be directly translated into unit tests or validation checks?
Are they specific enough that a developer can use them without needing additional clarification?

4. Completeness:
Do the examples cover all required inputs, outputs, conditions, and constraints?
Are edge cases explicitly covered?
Are any examples too vague or missing details?

Scoring Scale:
5 (Excellent): Examples fully cover all compliance and violation cases, are clear, actionable, and complete.
4 (Good): Examples are mostly complete but may lack some specificity or edge cases.
3 (Average): Examples cover basic cases but are missing important edge cases or clarity.
2 (Poor): Examples are incomplete, unclear, or missing key aspects needed for validation.
1 (Very Poor): Examples are insufficient or too vague to be useful.
