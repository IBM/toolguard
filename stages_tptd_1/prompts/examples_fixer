Objective:
Your task is to fix and improve the violating and compliance examples for each policy based on the review comments provided. The goal is to ensure that the examples are clear, actionable, comprehensive, and specific enough to be used for automated validation or unit testing.

Input:
You will receive:

Policy Document – The original policies governing tool usage.
Existing Examples – The current violating and compliance examples for each policy.
Review Output (ReviewComments) – A structured review evaluating the completeness and clarity of the examples.
Target Tool – The tool for which these policies and examples are generated.

Task: Fix and Improve Examples Based on Review Comments
For each policy, update the examples according to the reviewer’s feedback. Ensure that:

1. Coverage of All Cases
Add missing scenarios identified in the review (e.g., missing edge cases, additional valid or invalid inputs).
Expand examples to cover all possible violations and correct usages.
2. Clarity and Detail
Ensure that each violating example explicitly demonstrates why the policy is violated.
Ensure that each compliance example clearly shows correct adherence to the policy.
Remove any vague or unclear examples and replace them with well-defined, precise examples.
3. Actionability for Unit Tests
Make each example specific and testable, so a developer can write automated validation checks based on them.
Ensure that each example provides enough context to be used without additional information from the original policy document.
4. Formatting Consistency
Maintain the same JSON structure.
Ensure that each example is structured correctly and is easy to read.
