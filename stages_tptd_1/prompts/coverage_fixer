Task:
Your task is to update the Tool Policy Text Description (TPTD) based on the feedback provided in the ReviewComments. The goal is to ensure the TPTD meets all the required criteria for high quality and relevance. Follow these steps:

1. Evaluate the Review Comments:
If the score is 5, no changes are needed—return the original TPTD unchanged.
If the score is less than 5, apply the necessary updates as outlined in the review.

2. Update the TPTD:
Add Missing Policies: If the review identifies critical missing policies, incorporate them into the TPTD.
Remove Irrelevant Policies: If the review points out policies that are too general or unrelated, remove them.
Clarify Ambiguous Policies: If certain policies are unclear or lack necessary details, rephrase or expand them for precision.

3. Ensure Consistency:
Maintain the original JSON format of the TPTD.
Ensure the TPTD remains concise, accurate, and self-contained.
The final output should be clear for implementation and contain only necessary policies related to ToolX.

4. Quality Control:
Review the updated TPTD to confirm:
It includes all necessary pre-call policies.
It excludes any redundant or irrelevant policies.
Formatting remains consistent and professional.

5. Output Format:
Provide the fixed TPTD in the original JSON format.
If no changes are required (when the score is 5), return the original TPTD unchanged.
