    """
    Improve the previous tool-call check rules (in IBM Operational Decision Manager, ODM, Business Rules (Action Rules), BAL syntax) to cover all tool policy-items according to the review-comments.

    Args:
        prev_impl (FileTwin): previous implementation of the rules to check tool-call adherence.
        ruleset_src (FileTwin): The business Ruleset definition, with its input, output and rule.
        bom_src (FileTwin): the input Business Object Model (BOM) with name and JSON schema.
        policy_item (ToolPolicyItem): Requirements for this tool.
        review_comments (List[str]): Review comments on the current implementation. For example, pylint errors or Failed unit-tests.

    Returns:
        str: Improved rules decleration in ODM BAL syntax.

    **Implementation Rules:**"
    - ALL tool policy items must be validated on the tool arguments.
    - The rules should be simple.
    - The rules should be well documented.
    - You should just validate the tool-call. You should never call the tool itself.
