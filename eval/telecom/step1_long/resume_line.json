      "comments": "The policy is directly relevant to ToolX, which is responsible for resuming a suspended line. It is tool-specific as it only applies when the line resumption functionality is used. The policy cannot be technically validated before invoking ToolX, because it depends on user action after the tool\u2019s actions are complete. However, it is actionable in the sense that the instruction can be communicated to the user during the interaction. The policy is clear, complete, and does not require additional context to understand, hence it is self-contained.\nThis policy is relevant as it directly pertains to the action of resuming a suspended line using ToolX. It specifically instructs a follow-up action for users post-resumption, aligning with the tool's purpose of setting line status to Active. The policy is actionable as it is tied to an explicit action that agents must communicate. However, compliance with the policy cannot be validated before invoking ToolX, as it relies on user actions after line resumption. The policy is self-contained, providing complete and clear guidance without requiring additional context.\nThe policy is relevant and directly applies to the tool usage for resuming a suspended line and the subsequent user interaction by instructing a device reboot. It is specific to ToolX as it refers to the immediate action following the line resumption. While the resumption can be validated using ToolX\u2019s capabilities, instructing a device reboot is a manual action that cannot be validated through tools before the step is completed, thus 'can_be_validated' is false. The policy is clear, actionable, and self-contained as it does not require any further context from the policy document.\nThis policy is relevant to ToolX as it directly refers to the action of resuming a line which is the function of ToolX. It is tool-specific because it addresses a procedural step following the use of ToolX (resuming a line). However, the policy cannot be validated before ToolX is used as it is concerned with post-action instructions, and does not involve any pre-resumption checks or validations. Since the policy gives a clear directive that can be executed by informing the user within the chat history, it is actionable. The policy is self-contained because the instruction is clear and does not rely on additional context from the policy document. Overall, the policy is straightforward and effectively describes an action that should be taken after using ToolX.\n"

      "comments": "The policy is relevant to the tool 'resume_line', as it involves management of suspended lines. However, it is not specific to ToolX since it applies more broadly to line suspension tools, including 'suspend_line'. The policy cannot be validated before invoking ToolX as it requires checking the duration of suspension, which may not be directly actionable or verifiable using chat history or tool parameters alone. The policy description lacks clarity concerning how to enforce this duration restriction, making it not self-contained. An improved version is suggested to reflect the need to check suspension durations accurately.\nThe policy does not directly apply to the function of resuming a suspended line as its main focus is the act of suspending lines rather than resuming them. The current description mainly dictates behavior for suspending lines and does not address the resumption. The requirement to check the suspension duration can be validated using the suspension_start_date, but as the target tool resumes lines, checking is not actionable within ToolX. The policy description is missing necessary context around how suspension management works within the setup, making it less self-contained. The alternative description aims to incorporate relevant aspects of the policy applicable to resuming lines, which adds clarity. Overall, the policy is not target-tool-specific, too broad, and mainly relevant for tools that manage suspensions.\nThe policy is relevant to ToolX, specifically the 'resume_line' tool, and requires validation of the suspension period before using ToolX. However, the policy itself is not actionable using just the tool's parameters, chat history, or data access because it requires checking historical data (suspension_start_date) which might need additional context. The policy description, while specific, could be further simplified to make it self-contained, leading to the alternative description provided.\nThe policy is indeed relevant and specific to the 'resume_line' tool as it deals directly with line suspension parameters. The tool description and policy document make this necessity explicit for compliance. While one can validate the duration aspect before invoking the tool, the actionability relies on having access to the suspension_start_date, which is not specified in the tool description itself, thus limiting enforceability solely with ToolX. The original description references the maximum duration indirectly; therefore, providing a more precise description improves its self-containment. Overall, the policy lacks clarity for direct enforceability with tool parameters, giving it a partial score.\n"
