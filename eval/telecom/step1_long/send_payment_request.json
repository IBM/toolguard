      "description": "Before using 'ToolX' to send a payment request, manually verify that the customer's bill is labeled 'Overdue' and confirm that no other bills are currently 'Awaiting Payment'. 'ToolX' cannot ascertain this, thus pre-verification is essential.",
      "references": [
        "The send payement request tool will not check if the bill is overdue. You should always check that the bill is overdue before sending a payment request.",
        "Important:\n- A user can only have one bill in the AWAITING PAYMENT status at a time."

      "violating_examples": [
        "Attempting to send a payment request for a customer whose bill is marked 'Paid'. The tool will not check the bill status; hence this violates the policy requiring manual verification of an overdue status.",
        "Using ToolX to send a payment request for a customer who already has another bill marked as 'Awaiting Payment'. This is a clear violation as it breaches the condition of having only one bill awaiting payment at any time.",
        "Sending a payment request for a bill not labeled 'Overdue'. The tool doesn't check this status, thus violating the necessity of manual status checks.",
        "Sending a payment request for a nonexistent customer ID or bill ID, disregarding the required validation of their existence before using the tool."
      ],
      "compliance_examples": [
        "Before calling ToolX, ensure that the customer's bill is labeled 'Overdue' and that there are no other bills awaiting payment for this customer. Both conditions are checked manually, making this compliant.",
        "The tool is used to send a payment request after confirming the bill is overdue and verifying it's the only bill with the status to be updated. This matches all preconditions stated in the policy.",
        "Carefully verifying the customer ownership of the bill and its overdue status ensures adherence to the policy, successfully implementing pre-verification steps.",
        "Ensure the customer status is valid, the bill is overdue, and verify no other bill is 'Awaiting Payment' before sending payment, effectively satisfying the preconditions.",
        "Prior to using ToolX, confirm the customer ownership matches the owner of the bill and verify no other bills are in 'Awaiting Payment' status for compliance with the verification pre-requisites."
