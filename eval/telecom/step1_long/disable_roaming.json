      "comments": "While the policy is clear in specifying workflow management, it is general across all tool types rather than specific to 'Disables international roaming on a line.' The policy is more about behavior and process efficiency than direct relevance to the tool's function. It could be simplified to emphasize separation of actions, making it more self-contained in interpretation.\nThe policy is relevant as it pertains to the operational procedure when using tools like 'Disables international roaming on a line' (ToolX). However, it is not tool-specific because it applies broadly to all tool usage in agent protocols. It can be verified before ToolX is invoked ensuring that no simultaneous user interaction is taking place. The policy is actionable as it is enforceable through operational conduct of separating tool calls and user responses. However, the description is not self-contained as it lacks clarity without accompanying references. The alternative provided is a more concise version ensuring clarity without needing external context.\nThe policy is general guidance applicable to any tool use rather than specifically tailored to \u2018Disables international roaming on a line\u2019. While this policy can be validated since actions can be tracked to ensure separation of tool calls and user responses, it is not specifically relevant to the target tool and thus, not tool-specific in applicability. The policy is clear and actionable on its own.\nThe policy is clear in its directive to avoid simultaneous tool usage and user interaction, ensuring procedural clarity. However, it is a general guideline applicable to all tool usage rather than specific to ToolX. It establishes a guideline that is inherently verifiable by maintaining action logs or observing process flow, making it actionable.\nThe policy is primarily about interaction sequencing rather than specific tool functionality, so it's not directly relevant to the operation of 'Disable Roaming'. It does not depend on the tool's parameters. Therefore, it is not actionable within the operations of this tool. The policy is self-contained as it clearly states the intended action and sequencing. The score is low due to its broad applicability and lack of specific relevance and actionable guidance for the targeted tool.\n"
