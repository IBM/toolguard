      "comments": "The policy is relevant to ToolX as it pertains to tool call behavior, which affects how ToolX is invoked. The rule is not specific only to ToolX, as it applies to any tool usage by the telecom agent. It can be validated easily by checking if other tools are being called or if there is a response during the ToolX invocation. The policy is actionable with ToolX's parameters because it concerns the sequence of actions when using tools. As the policy is clear and self-contained, it needs no further adjustments for context or clarity.\nThe policy applies generally to all tools, including ToolX, as it addresses the agent's behavior when using any tool. It can be validated before using ToolX by ensuring no simultaneous actions, such as tool calls and user responses being made. However, the enforceability of ensuring only one tool call is not determined by ToolX parameters, chat history, or data access. The policy is clear and complete within the context provided, but it lacks actionable steps specific to ToolX beyond general governance of tool use.\nThe policy is applicable to ToolX since it involves making a tool call, but the policy is general and not specific only to ToolX. Compliance can be checked before tool invocation since it involves procedural adherence. The previous description lacked context on the scope of tools covered, making it less self-contained. An alternate description provided offers clearer understanding and completeness, enhancing the scope and clarity of application.\nThe policy is specifically relevant to 'retrieving current billing cycle data usage for a line' as the target tool function. It is tool-specific as it's directly mentioning the interaction constraints with ToolX. The policy can be validated as the agent can check for concurrent interactions or tool calls, but it is not actionable purely with ToolX's parameters as the agent needs to oversee their conduct on interaction timing beyond just data access. The policy is not fully self-contained as it references a general approach applicable to all tools without specifying distinct procedures for the data usage retrieval, which may benefit from clear step-by-step instructions or outlined constraints pertinent to ToolX. A more self-contained version has been provided, aimed at focusing specifically on ToolX usage without assuming knowledge from broader policy contexts. It can improve clarity and direct applicability within that scope.\n"

      "policy_name": "Customer Verification Policy",
      "description": "Before utilizing ToolX or any other tool, ensure customer identity verification is completed using one of the following: customer ID, phone number, or full name with date of birth. This step guarantees a secure and tailored experience.",
      "references": [
        "You must first identify the customer."
      ],
      "iteration_added": 0,
      "comments": "The policy states that customer identity must be verified before providing technical support. While this action can be validated using available customer lookup methods such as 'get_customer_by_id', 'get_customer_by_name', and 'get_customer_by_phone', it does not apply directly to the target tool, which deals with data usage information retrieval. The policy also lacks detail about how to perform the verification, such as steps or conditions, making it not fully actionable in the context of ToolX. It is focused on the initial phase of support but doesn't directly govern the tool's usage. Therefore, while verifying identity is a valid concern, it is not specific to or relevant for ToolX.\nThis policy is not specifically related to the target tool, which is used for data usage retrieval. The policy is relevant for verifying customer identity before any technical support interaction, not directly actionable with this tool. It's a general step that needs to be completed before many tool-based interactions but is not enforced via ToolX. However, the policy can be validated as customer identity verification is feasible before any actionable support is provided. To improve self-containment, I proposed an expanded description to clarify context and purpose more thoroughly.\nThe policy is relevant to ToolX as it involves verifying customer information, which is essential for retrieving data usage. However, the policy is not specific to ToolX, as customer verification applies to all tool usage. The policy can be validated, and it is actionable, as customer verification is a prerequisite for tool usage. The description lacks specificity regarding the verification means, which is why an improved version has been suggested. Score: 4 - The policy is clear but lacks completeness in defining verification.\nThe policy is broadly relevant across all tools as it refers to identity verification before tool usage. It does not target ToolX specifically, which is designed to retrieve data usage for a line. It is possible to verify compliance with the policy by checking if valid customer identifiers are provided. However, the policy does not outline specific actions that are enforceable solely through ToolX. Therefore, it would be more fitting if the policy was linked with procedures for collecting relevant customer data to integrate it with ToolX's functionality. This limitation affects the policy's actionability and relevance to ToolX, hence the score. Score - 2.\nThe policy is relevant to ToolX as it emphasizes the need for verifying the customer's identity before using any tool, including ToolX. However, it is broadly applicable and not specific to ToolX alone. Compliance with the policy can be validated before invoking the tool, ensuring security and personalized service. Nonetheless, the policy is only actionable after identity verification via one of the specified methods, indicating it's not enforceable using ToolX alone. Improvement is needed for the policy to be self-contained, and the proposed alternative description offers clarity and completeness without requiring additional context from the policy document.\n"
