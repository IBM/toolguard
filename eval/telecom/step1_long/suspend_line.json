      "comments": "The policy is relevant and specific to the 'suspend_line' tool, making it tool-specific. It is actionable as it provides guidance that can be enforced through the tool operations. However, the policy cannot be validated before invoking the tool since it does not specify how to track the suspension duration or automate checks. It could become self-contained by including context on how to ensure the tool adheres to the six-month constraint, possibly through automated checks or conditions within the tool usage.\nThe policy is relevant and specific to the 'suspend_line' tool, directly referencing the duration constraint it enforces. However, the original policy description is not actionable because it asks for adjustments to be made without specifying how these should be identified or executed with the tool parameters. The policy provides sufficient information to validate actions before using ToolX by tracking the suspension start date. The policy isn't self-contained, as it requires relying on assumptions about tool tracking capabilities, hence an alternative, concise description is suggested to clarify execution using tool's features. Score: There is potential for immediate validation, but clarity and actionable detail are lacking, which affects enforcement ease, leading to a score of 3.\nThe policy is directly relevant to the 'suspend_line' tool, making it specific and actionable for ToolX as it is inherently built into ToolX's functionality. However, the policy's validation aspect is limited because it requires ongoing monitoring of suspension durations, which can't be verified prior to using the tool. Still, the policy is precise, clear, and doesn't require additional context, enabling straightforward implementation. Since only suspended lines have their start dates, issues regarding exceeding the time limit should be addressed by monitoring suspension durations regularly.\nThe policy is relevant to ToolX (suspend_line) as it directly limits the suspension duration, ensuring compliance with the six-month limit. However, it cannot be validated before invoking ToolX since there is no way to check suspension dates prior to making a tool call that alters suspension records. The policy is not actionable using only ToolX parameters and requires external monitoring of suspension durations. Also, the policy lacks clarity on how suspension dates should be monitored and does not specify actions needed for this verification. Proposed an alternative description to improve clarity and ensure the policy is self-contained.\nThe policy is clearly targeted and tool-specific, as it directly refers to attributes of the 'suspend_line' tool. However, it does not outline how to verify ongoing compliance with the six-month suspension duration. This step seems difficult to validate in advance or during local operations without external monitoring or reminders, which makes direct validation challenging. The description needs refinement as it does not include action monitoring directives, but offers clear instructions for the initial suspension setup. The alternative description improves clarity by focusing solely on immediate tool usage constraints without ongoing monitoring, thus being self-contained in its immediate operational context.\n"

      "policy_name": "Transfer Protocol for Suspension Issues",
      "description": "When faced with a line suspension scenario that cannot be resolved using available tools due to constraints like the line's contract expiration, agents must transfer the case to a human agent. The agent should exhaust all other possible solutions first. To initiate a transfer, use the 'transfer_to_human_agents' tool, followed by notifying the customer: 'YOU ARE BEING TRANSFERRED TO A HUMAN AGENT. PLEASE HOLD ON.'",
      "references": [
        "You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions. To transfer, first make a tool call to transfer_to_human_agents, and then send the message 'YOU ARE BEING TRANSFERRED TO A HUMAN AGENT. PLEASE HOLD ON.' to the user."

      "comments": "The policy is relevant to ToolX since it involves handling suspension issues, which ToolX can address by suspending lines. However, the policy lacks specificity regarding when the transfer should occur, especially concerning suspension reasons that cannot be resolved (like contract end date). The policy is actionable in terms of validating reasons before transferring, but it is not tailored exclusively to ToolX. It could be improved by clarifying the circumstances under which the policy guides the transfer beyond suspending a line\u2014specifically focusing on contract-related limitations. The score reflects these gaps and the need for additional context to make the document self-contained.\nThe policy is relevant to ToolX as it relates to the suspension and transfer protocol. However, it lacks specificity regarding ToolX, making it non-tool-specific, as this transfer protocol can apply broadly across different scenarios. The policy can be validated before invoking ToolX, as it requires checking if issues are beyond the agent's capacity to resolve. As the current description lacks clear boundaries for actionable usage, it cannot be enforced solely using ToolX parameters and history. To improve self-containment, specific tool capabilities and constraints, such as the inability to lift suspension when the contract end date is past, should be more elaborately outlined in the description. Given these considerations, improvement is essential for clarity and completeness, as indicated in the alternative description.\nThe policy is useful for general agent actions but does not apply specifically to ToolX, which handles line suspensions. While it can be validated before use (checking the policy and tools capability), it lacks specificity and doesn't address ToolX's procedures directly. It provides actionable steps but may need refinement to highlight ToolX and its parameters. The description needs clarification about ToolX\u2019s direct involvement with suspension and when transfers aren\u2019t possible. A score of 3 is assigned due to these gaps and the need for greater specificity regarding ToolX usage.\nThe current policy is directly relevant to ToolX because it addresses line suspension issues, which ToolX specifically handles. While the policy can be validated by exhausting all available tools, its actionability is limited because it requires external confirmation that all other options are unavailable before proceeding. The policy could be clearer by specifying more detailed steps to assess when suspensions can or cannot be resolved. A more self-contained version would explicitly define procedures for determining the necessity of transfer based on policy and tool constraints. Given the need for additional context and not purely actionable with ToolX's parameters alone, I rate this policy a 3.\nThis policy is relevant to suspension issues related to line contracts, making it applicable to ToolX. The policy requires agents to transfer users to a human agent when resolution is beyond tool capabilities, aligning with tool constraint scenarios like line suspension due to contract end dates. While actionable and can be validated beforehand, the policy lacks specificity regarding the tools that should be used prior to invoking transfer to human agents. The alternative description improves clarity by explicitly stating the constraint due to contract expiration and emphasizes the procedure of exhausting all options. The score reflects the need for a more detailed self-contained description.\n"
