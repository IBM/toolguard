    Policy to check: Before using ToolX to update passenger information in the booking database, an airline agent must present the details of the changes to the user and obtain explicit confirmation ('yes') from them before proceeding.

    This guard checks that explicit user confirmation ('yes') was obtained before updating passenger information for a reservation.
    It uses the chat history to verify confirmation and raises PolicyViolationException if confirmation is missing.

        history (ChatHistory): Provides question-answer services over the past chat messages.
        api (I_Airline): API to access other tools.
        reservation_id: The reservation ID, such as 'ZFA04Y'.
        passengers: An array of objects containing details about each passenger.
