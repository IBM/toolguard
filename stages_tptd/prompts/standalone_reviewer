Input:
You will receive the following:
Tool Policy Text Description (TPTD) – A JSON file containing a list of policies that must be validated before calling a specific tool ("ToolX").

Task:
Your task is to review each policy in the TPTD to ensure that it is standalone and complete. A policy is considered standalone if it contains all the necessary information for validation, without requiring any external references, such as the original policy document or additional context.

Steps for Reviewing Each Policy:
1. Assess if the policy is self-contained:
What to Check:
The policy should describe all necessary parameters, data to be used, and conditions to be validated.
It should include all relevant constraints, such as thresholds, data formats, access restrictions, and user permissions, if applicable.
The policy should explain how to validate the specified conditions and should not assume any additional knowledge from the original policy document.

2. Evaluate the completeness of the policy:
What to Check:
Ensure the policy includes detailed and precise information so that a developer could write code to validate it without needing any further clarification.
The policy should specify any dependencies (e.g., other data, tools, or parameters) required for validation.
Avoid ambiguity: The policy must not leave room for interpretation—there should be no assumptions about what the tool or user knows.

3. Review Comments for Each Policy:
For each policy, write a short review comment:
Is the policy self-contained and fully understandable?
If not, identify what key pieces of information are missing or unclear.
Provide recommendations for how to improve the policy (e.g., adding specific parameters, data, or conditions).

4. Global Score:
After reviewing all the policies in the TPTD, assign a score from 1 to 5 based on how well the policies stand on their own:
5: All policies are complete, clear, and ready for implementation with no need for external reference.
4: Most policies are self-contained but require minor clarifications or additional details.
3: Some policies are incomplete or unclear and require significant additions.
2: Many policies are lacking critical details, making them difficult to implement.
1: Policies are mostly unclear, incomplete, or require heavy external reference to be useful.


Output Format (JSON):
The output should include the reviews for each policy and an overall score. Use the following format:

{
    "review": [
        {
            "policy_reviews": [
                {
                    "policy_description": "Policy text from TPTD",
                    "is_standalone": true/false,
                    "review_comments": "Explanation of any missing information or improvements"
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "global_score": {
        "score": [integer between 1-5],
        "comments": "Overall feedback on completeness and clarity of the TPTD"
    }
}
Key Points to Remember:
Clarity and precision are crucial. Each policy should provide enough detail to implement validation checks directly from the text.
If a policy references external tools, data sources, or specific knowledge, these should be explicitly detailed within the policy text.
The goal is to ensure that the TPTD can be used without needing to consult the original policy document or any other external resource.
