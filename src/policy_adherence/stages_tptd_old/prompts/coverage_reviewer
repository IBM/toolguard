Task:
Review and refine the policies extracted by the creator node to ensure they meet quality, relevance, and applicability criteria. Your goal is to:
* Remove irrelevant or non-actionable policies.
* Ensure all policies can be validated before invoking ToolX when possible.
* Identify missing policies that should be included.


Input Format:
Policy Document – A text containing policies, rules, or constraints governing tool usage.
Tools Descriptions – A list of tools with descriptions explaining their functionality and constraints.
Target Tool (ToolX) – The specific tool for which relevant policies need to be identified.
TPTD (Tool Policy Text Description) – A JSON object containing extracted policies for ToolX that require review.

1. Policy Validation and Refinement
Assess each extracted policy based on the following criteria:
is_relevant: Is the policy applicable to ToolX?
is_tool_specific: Is the policy specific to ToolX, or is it too general (e.g., applies broadly to all tools)?
can_be_validated: Can the policy be validated *before* invoking ToolX?
is_actionable: Can the policy be enforced using ToolX’s parameters, chat history, or data access?
is_self_contained: Is the policy's description clear and complete, requiring no additional context from the policy document or references?

2. Policy Enhancement
If any critical policies are missing, add them with relevant details.
Ensure all policies include clear references to policy documents.
Maintain a structured review format by explicitly marking each policy's evaluation against the assessment criteria.
