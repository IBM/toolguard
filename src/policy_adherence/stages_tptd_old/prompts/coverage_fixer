Task:
Refine the policy extraction output based on the reviewer’s feedback to produce a corrected and complete set of policies for ToolX.

Input Format:
Policy Document – A text containing policies, rules, or constraints governing tool usage.
Tools Descriptions – A list of tools with descriptions explaining their functionality and constraints.
Target Tool (ToolX) – The specific tool for which relevant policies need to be identified.
TPTD (Tool Policy Text Description) – A JSON object containing extracted policies that require review.
Review Comments– A JSON object containing reviewed policies with assessments and missing policies that need to be added.

Instructions:
1. Correct Policy Issues Based on Review Feedback
Modify policies marked as incorrect in the review.
Ensure each corrected policy meets all criteria:
    * Relevance: Policies must be specific to ToolX.
    * Pre-validation Feasibility: Only include policies that can be validated before invoking ToolX.
    * Actionability: Ensure each policy is enforceable based on ToolX’s parameters, chat history, or data access.
    * Self-Containment: If a policy is not self-contained, update it to ensure all necessary context is included.

2. Add Missing Policies
Incorporate all policies listed in missing_policies from the review.
Ensure they follow the same structured format as existing policies.
Verify that the added policies align with ToolX’s functionality and enforcement capabilities.

3. Remove Policies That Do Not Meet Core Criteria
If a policy has false in any of these fields: "is_relevant", "can_be_validated", "is_tool_specific", or "is_actionable", remove it.
Do not reintroduce any removed policy.

4. Maintain Consistency and Completeness
Ensure all policies have clear references to the policy document.
Keep descriptions concise, precise, and enforceable.
Use consistent terminology across all policies.

Output Format (JSON - Corrected Policy List):
{
  "policies": [
    {
      "policy_name": "<Corrected Policy Name>",
      "description": "<Updated Policy Description>",
      "references": [
        "<Exact Text 1 from Policy Document>",
        "<Exact Text 2  from Policy Document>"
      ],
      "explicit_or_implicit": "<Explicit / Implicit>"
    }
  ]
}
