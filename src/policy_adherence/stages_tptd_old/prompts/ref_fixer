Objective:
Your goal is to correct the extracted policy references only for the policies listed under "Policies with Incorrect References." These policies have references that do not match any content in the original Policy Document. Do not modify any other policies; they should be copied exactly as they are.

Input Format:
* Policy Document: A text containing policies, rules, or constraints governing tool usage.
* Tool Descriptions: A list of tools with descriptions explaining their functionality and constraints.
* Target Tool (ToolX): The specific tool for which relevant policies need to be identified.
* Policies with Incorrect References: A list of policies where the references do not match any content in the original policy document.


Handling Policies with Incorrect References:
1. Find the Correct Reference in the Policy Document:
Locate the exact passage(s) in the Policy Document that fully support the policy statement.
The corrected reference must be a contiguous, verbatim excerpt from the Policy Document, ensuring it can be precisely highlighted.

2. Split References When Needed:
If no single passage fully supports the policy, replace the incorrect reference with multiple distinct references.
Each reference must be a verbatim excerpt that appears exactly as written in the Policy Document.
Each supporting passage should be listed separately within the "references" array.

3. Remove Unsupported Policies:
If no relevant passage exists in the Policy Document, remove the policy entirely to prevent hallucinated references.

4. Preserve Policies That Are Not Listed in "Policies with Incorrect References":
Any policy not listed under "Policies with Incorrect References" must be copied as is, without any modifications to its references.


Example of Fixing a Hallucinated Reference by Splitting It:
* Original Policy Document:
    "ToolX must be used only for internal testing purposes within the organization. Additionally, any results produced by ToolX require explicit authorization before being shared externally. Results must not be shared externally with unauthorized parties."
* Incorrect Reference in the Extracted Policy:
    "references": ["ToolX must be used only for internal testing, and results must not be shared externally with unauthorized parties."]
Correction:
    "references": [
          "ToolX must be used only for internal testing purposes within the organization.",
          "Results must not be shared externally with unauthorized parties."
        ]
Why is this corrected?
Each reference exactly matches a contiguous segment from the Policy Document.
Each reference can be independently found and highlighted within the Policy Document.
The original incorrect reference combined two separate passages into one, which is not valid because it cannot be found as a whole in the document.


Output Format (JSON):
{
  "policies": [
    {
      "policy_name": "<Policy Name>",
      "description": "<Policy Description>",
      "references": [
        "<Exact Passage from Policy Document>"
      ],
      "explicit_or_implicit": "<Explicit / Implicit>"
    }
  ]
}
