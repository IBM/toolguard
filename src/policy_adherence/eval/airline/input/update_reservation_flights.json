However, it is not specific to ToolX, as it applies to all tools and their usage.

Clarifying these criteria will aid in the tool\u2019s operation and ensure compliance can be validated. Score reflects the policy's lack of specificity and detail regarding ToolX's role.\nThe policy is indeed relevant for ToolX, which deals with updating reservation flights.

The alternative description provides a clear list of controlled items to check against policies, making it more self-contained.\nThe policy is relevant and specifically targeted towards the 'update_reservation_flights' tool as it deals with modifying existing flight reservations. The policy can be validated before usage since it involves checking compliance with set rules, such as cabin change, flight segment modification, and baggage and payment method updates. However, it is not directly actionable as described because the policy requires an explicit process to enforce denial of non-compliant requests, which should be integrated into the action-taking mechanism. The original policy description was not self-contained as it lacked clarity on the exact procedures for validation and enforcement; the suggested alternative description addresses these gaps and provides a clearer guideline.\nThe policy is relevant to ToolX ('update_reservation_flights') as it focuses on ensuring compliance with policies when updating flight reservations. It is specific to tool usage and enforcement of defined rules, making it both relevant and tool-specific. It can be validated by checking user requests against the policy requirements before tool invocation. However, the policy lacks clarity on what standards or checks are necessary, making actionable enforcement challenging.

Score: 3, as it lacks specificity and cannot be proactively enforced using ToolX\u2019s parameters.\nThis policy is relevant as it outlines conditions for transferring requests to human agents, which is pertinent when using the 'update_reservation_flights' tool. However, it's not tool-specific as it applies broadly to all scenarios where requests exceed tool capabilities. The policy cannot be validated before invoking ToolX because it lacks specific conditions tied to ToolX's parameters that would trigger a transfer.

However, it's not tool-specific because it pertains to conditions outside the reality of any particular tool and requires judgment. It cannot be validated before using ToolX since it depends on the tool's processing or context received from a user interaction, not prior verification. It is actionable as it provides guidance when to refer a user to a human agent if a tool cannot handle the request. The description is self-contained and clear, offering specific instruction without needing more context from the policy document.

While the policy can be validated before invoking ToolX, it is not actionable solely through the parameters of the update_reservation_flights tool, as modifying passenger details pertains to a different tool, such as update_reservation_passengers. Additionally, the current description isn't self-contained; it requires insight that the rule applies universally across reservation tools and is beyond agent aid, which isn't clear from the brief wording. The alternative description broadens this to improve clarity and completeness.\nThe policy is relevant to ToolX (update_reservation_flights) since it outlines constraints on passenger modification during reservation updates. However, it is not tool-specific because it generally applies to multiple reservation modification tools. The policy can be validated by checking if the number of passengers remains constant before using ToolX. It is actionable because the parameters for ToolX do not involve passenger count changes, ensuring compliance directly through the tool's constraints. The policy is currently not fully self-contained since it references practices applicable 'across all reservation modification tools.' The proposed alternative version helps clarify ToolX involvement and avoids broader referencing, focusing directly on its application. Score: 4 - The policy is clear but lacks tool specificity and could benefit from a concise, standalone description.\nThe evaluated policy, 'Passenger Modification Restriction,' does not appear to directly relate to the 'update_reservation_flights' tool, which centers on updating flight details, not passenger modifications. Therefore, it lacks relevance and tool specificity, leading to non-actionability within the context of the specific tool. Furthermore, although this policy is somewhat self-contained, it links actions to a tool whose primary operation does not encompass passenger alteration. The suggested improved version provides clearer guidance without mistakenly attributing operations to a non-relevant tool.\nThe policy is not directly relevant to the tool 'update_reservation_flights,' as this tool is focused on updating flight details rather than passenger modifications. It does not rely on ToolX and does not provide any specifics related to what is handled by 'update_reservation_flights.' The restriction on passenger modification can be validated before invoking any tool that pertains to passenger management, but it is not actionable with 'update_reservation_flights'. Since the user cannot modify passenger numbers using any tool or even through human intervention, it is impossible to enforce this policy using the parameters or capabilities of ToolX. However, the policy description is clear and self-contained.\n"}]}
