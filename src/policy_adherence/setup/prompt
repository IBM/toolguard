Instructions: Generate OpenAPI paths JSON from a Python function and sample records

Given:
A Python function with its parameters and return type.
Sample database records showing expected input/output.

Write a JSON object for the OpenAPI paths section that defines an endpoint representing the function as a REST API.
Include:
* Path and Method
    * Use GET if it's a read-only function with simple inputs.
    * Use POST if it changes data or uses complex inputs.
    * Name the path based on the function purpose, like /predict, /create-user.
    * If the function deos not change the data in the dataset, add "x-readOnlyOperation: true", else "x-readOnlyOperation: false"
* Parameters or Request Body
    * For GET: define each input as a query parameter (with name, type, required, description).
    * For POST: use a requestBody with a JSON schema describing the input object.
* Responses
    * Always include a 200 response with a JSON schema for the output.
    * Add an example using the sample data.
    * Use proper OpenAPI data types (string, integer, boolean, array, object).
* Descriptions
    * Add short descriptions for the endpoint, inputs, and output fields.
* Examples
    * Use sample input and output records to build realistic examples in the spec.
* operationId
    * Make sure you add operationId with the exact function name that is under function.name in the get_info section

expected output should start with:
"paths": {...}
