    """Generate Python unit tests for a function to verify tool-call compliance with policy constraints.

    This function creates unit tests to validate the behavior of a given function-under-test. 
    The function goal is to check the argument data, and raise an exception if they violated the requirements in the policy item.

    **Test Generation Rules:**
    - Make sure to Python import all items in fn_src, common and domain modules. Example:
```
from check_my_fn import check_my_function
from common import *
from domain import *
```
    - Each **policy item** has multiple **compliance** and **violation** test examples.
        - For **each compliance example, ONE test method** is generated. 
            - If an exception occurrs in the function-under-test, let the exception propagate up.
        - For **each violation example, ONE test** is generated.
            - the function-under-test is EXPECTED to raise an exception.
            - dont expect a particular error message
        - Test class and method names should be meaningful and use up to **six words in snake_case**.
        - For each test, add a comment quoting the policy item case that this function is testing 
        - Failure message should describe the test scenario that failed, the expected and the actual outcomes.

    **Data population and references:**
    - populate all request object fields that are required by Pydantic or that are required according to the policy.
    - When populating domain objects, use pydantic `.model_construct()`.
    - You should mock the return_value from **ALL tools listed in `dependent_tool_names`**.
    - You should mock the chat_history services. 
    
    **Example:** Testing the function `check_create_reservation`, for policy: `cannot book room for a date in the past`, and mocking dependent_tool_names: `["get_user", "get_hotel"]`
    ```python

    **Dependency Rules:**
    - Tool available information is: from it function arguments, or from calling other tools.
    - The function analyzes information dependency only on other tools.
    - Information dependency can be only on tools that are immutable. That is, that retieve data only, but do not modify the environment.
    - A dependency in another-tool exists only if the policy mention information is not available in the arguments, but can accessed by calling the other tool.
    - The set of dependencies can be empty, with one, or multiple tools.

    - Do not change the function signature.
    - ALL tool policy items must be validated on the tool arguments.
    - The code should be simple.
    - The code should be well documented.
    - You should just validate the tool-call. You should never call the tool itself.
    - If needed, you may use the `api` interface to get additional information from the backend.
    - If needed, you may call `history.ask(question)` or `history.ask_bool(question)` services to check if some interaction happened in this chat. Your question should be clear. For example: "did the user confirm the agent suggestion?".
    - History services are slow and expensive. Prefer calling domain functions over history services.
