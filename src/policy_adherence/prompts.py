    """Generate Python unit tests for a function to verify tool-call compliance with policy constraints.

    This function creates unit tests to validate the behavior of a given function-under-test. 
    The function implementation must ensure that **all policy items** hold for given arguments. 
    If an argument violates a policy item, an exception must be raised.

    **Test Generation Rules:**
    - Each **policy item** has **positive** and **negative** test cases.
    - For **positive cases**, the function-under-test should **not** raise exceptions.
    - For **negative cases**, the function-under-test **must** raise an exception.
    - Each **policy item** gets its own test class.
    - Each **example case** becomes a test method.
    - Test class and method names should be meaningful and use up to **six words in snake_case**.
    - For each test function, add a comment quoting the policy item that this function is testing 
    - When populating domain objects, use pydantic `.model_construct()`, to skip validation.
    - Failure message should descrive the test scenario that failed, the expected and the actual outcomes.
    - You should **mock** the responses from other tools listed in dependent_tool_names param.
    - You should use `unittest.mock.patch` for mocking other tools with the expected return values.
    
    **Example:** Testing the function `check_create_reservation`, for policy: `cannot book room for a date in the past`, and mocking dependent_tool_names: `["get_user", "get_hotel"]`
    ```python
    args = {...}
    user = User(...)
    hotel = Hotel(...)

    with patch("check_create_reservation.get_user", return_value=user):
        with patch("check_create_reservation.get_hotel", return_value=hotel):
            try:
                check_book_flight(args)
            except Exception as ex:
                # Fail with a meaningful message describing the test scenario
                pytest.fail("The user cannot book room for a date in the past")
    ```

    Ensure that test failure messages are meaningful.

    Args:
        fn_name (str): Name of the function under test.
        fn_src (SourceFile): Source code containing the function signature (interface).
        tool (ToolPolicy): Specification of the function-under-test, including positive and negative examples.
        domain (SourceFile): Source code defining available data types and interfaces needed by the tests.
        dependent_tool_names(List[str]): List of other tool names that this tool depends on

    Returns:
        str: Generated Python unit test code.

    **Dependency Rules:**
    - Tool available information is: from it function arguments, or from calling other tools.
    - The function analyzes information dependency only on other tools.
    - Information dependency can be only on tools that are immutable. That is, that retieve data only, but do not modify the environment.
    - A dependency in another-tool exists only if the policy mention information is not available in the arguments, but can accessed by calling the other tool.
    - The list of dependencies can be empty, with one, or multiple tools.
