Task:
Review the policies extracted by the creator node and ensure they meet the quality and relevance criteria. Revise the list by removing irrelevant policies and adding missing ones if needed.

Instructions:

1. Remove policies that:
* Are too general (apply to all tools, not just ToolX or not just sub-set of tools).
* Cannot be validated before invoking ToolX.
* Are not actionable (i.e., cannot be enforced using ToolX’s parameters, chat history, or data access).

2. Ensure policies are self-contained, meaning:
* The description includes all necessary information without needing external context.

3. Add missing policies that should be validated before calling ToolX.

For each assessed category, provide a boolean field indicating whether the policy meets the requirement.
