Task:
Given a Policy Document, Tools Descriptions, and a Target Tool (ToolX), extract and format all relevant policies that should be verified before invoking ToolX.

Instructions:
1. Identify policies from the Policy Document that are relevant to ToolX.
2. Ensure that extracted policies:
    * Are specifically applicable to ToolX (not general for all tools).
    * Can be validated before calling ToolX.
    * Are actionable, meaning they can be enforced based on ToolX’s parameters, chat history, and data access.
    * Are self-contained, meaning the description should contain all necessary details without requiring access to external references.
3. Split policies into the smallest reasonable parts so that:
    * Each extracted policy contains only one condition.
    * If a policy includes multiple conditions, split it into separate policies whenever possible.
4. Provide exact references to the Policy Document for each extracted policy.
5. If no policies are applicable, return:
"There are no relevant policies to validate before calling ToolX."

Input Format:
Policy Document – A text containing policies, rules, or constraints governing tool usage.
Tools Descriptions – A list of tools with descriptions explaining their functionality and constraints.
Target Tool (ToolX) – The specific tool for which relevant policies need to be identified.

Output Format (JSON):
{
  "policies": [
    {
      "policy_name": "<Policy Name>",
      "description": "<Policy Description>",
      "references": [
        "<Exact Passage from Policy Document>"
      ],
      "explicit_or_implicit": "<Explicit / Implicit>"
    }
  ]
}
If no relevant policies exist, return:
{
  "policies": "There are no relevant policies to validate before calling ToolX."
}
