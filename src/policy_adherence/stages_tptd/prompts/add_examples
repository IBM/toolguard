Task:
For the given policy, check if any examples (violating or compliance) are missing. If so, generate additional examples and return only the newly created examples, without modifying or repeating the existing ones.

Input Data:
Policy Document: A text containing policies, rules, or constraints governing tool usage. It may be a full document or a partial excerpt if the document is too long.
Tools Descriptions: A list of tools along with descriptions explaining their functionality and constraints.
Target Tool (ToolX): The specific tool for which relevant policies need to be identified.
Policy: The policy to write additional the examples for

Steps:
1.Identify Missing Examples:
Locate the examples under "examples".
If the "examples" array is missing or empty, generate new examples in natural text, both violating and compliance examples.
If only one type of example is missing (violating or compliance), generate only the missing type.
Do not repeat or modify existing examples—only add new ones.

2. Generate Violating Examples (if missing):
Provide new violating examples that highlight different ways the policy could be breached.
Cover common mistakes, edge cases, and boundary conditions.
Clearly state why each example violates the policy.

3. Generate Compliance Examples (if missing):
Provide new compliance examples demonstrating correct adherence to the policy.
Ensure compliance cases clearly illustrate why they meet the policy’s requirements.

4. Ensure Full Coverage:
If the policy has multiple conditions, generate examples covering each condition separately.
Consider numeric limits, timing constraints, and optional parameters where relevant.

5. Format the Output in JSON:
Only include newly generated examples. Make sure examples are written in natural text.
Maintain the correct structure:

{
    { "violating_examples": [
        "A user attempts to call ToolX without providing the required authentication token. Since the policy mandates that an authentication token must be present, this violates the rule.",
        "The input parameters for ToolX exceed the allowed character limit of 500, but the request is still made. This violates the policy, as inputs must comply with the character constraints.",
        "A request to ToolX includes a restricted keyword that is explicitly mentioned in the policy as disallowed. This makes the request non-compliant."
    ]},
    { "compliance_examples": [
        "A user successfully provides a valid authentication token before calling ToolX, ensuring compliance with the policy.",
        "The input parameters for ToolX remain within the allowed character limit, following the policy requirements.",
        "A request is made to ToolX with a properly formatted and authorized query, containing no restricted keywords."
    ]}

}

If no new examples are needed, return an empty object:

{}
