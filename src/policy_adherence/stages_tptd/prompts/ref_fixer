Task:
Adjust the policy extraction output according to the reviewer’s feedback.

Objective:
Your goal is to correct the extracted policy references based on the "Policies with Incorrect References" list, ensuring that all references accurately align with the original policy document.


Input Format:
* Policy Document: A text containing policies, rules, or constraints governing tool usage.
* Tool Descriptions: A list of tools with descriptions explaining their functionality and constraints.
* Target Tool (ToolX): The specific tool for which relevant policies need to be identified.
* Policies with Incorrect References: A list of policies where the references do not match any content in the original policy document.


Handling Policies with Incorrect References:
* For each incorrect reference, attempt to locate the correct reference within the original policy document.
* If a valid reference is found, replace the incorrect one.
* If no single valid reference exists but relevant passages can be found, split the reference into multiple supporting references.
* If the entire policy is unsupported by the original document, remove it completely.


Example of Fixing a Hallucinated Reference by Splitting It:
* Original Policy Document:
    "ToolX must be used only for internal testing purposes within the organization. Additionally, any results produced by ToolX require explicit authorization before being shared externally. Results must not be shared externally with unauthorized parties."
* Incorrect Reference in the Extracted Policy:
    "references": ["ToolX must be used only for internal testing, and results must not be shared externally with unauthorized parties."]
Correction:
    "references": [
          "ToolX must be used only for internal testing purposes within the organization.",
          "Results must not be shared externally with unauthorized parties."
        ]


Output Format (JSON):
{
  "policies": [
    {
      "policy_name": "<Policy Name>",
      "description": "<Policy Description>",
      "references": [
        "<Exact Passage from Policy Document>"
      ],
      "explicit_or_implicit": "<Explicit / Implicit>"
    }
  ]
}
