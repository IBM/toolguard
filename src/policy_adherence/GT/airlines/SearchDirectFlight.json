                "Attempting to call SearchDirectFlight for a flight with the status 'delayed'. Despite the flight being in the future, the policy states such flights cannot be booked, violating the direct flight search constraints.",
                "A user requests to search for a direct flight, and the SearchDirectFlight tool is used to list flights regardless of their status, including those marked as 'flying'. This violates the policy since only flights with the 'available' status should be processed.",
                "The SearchDirectFlight tool is invoked to check direct flights, but results include flights that are both 'on time' and 'available'. The use of the tool violates the policy, as 'on time' flights should not be included in the search for bookable flights.",
                "A search is conducted for direct flights using SearchDirectFlight, and the system retrieves flight data with the status 'flying'. The policy clearly indicates that flights with this status should not be searched in the context of finding bookable flights.",
                "Calling SearchDirectFlight without first filtering out flights with the 'on time' status, resulting in a mixed list of 'available' and 'on time' flights. This violates the policy which prohibits search results including 'on time' flights.",
                "A user makes a call to SearchDirectFlight for a flight without verifying the flight's status first, leading to the inclusion of potentially unbookable flights, such as those marked 'on time', which violates the policy.",
                "In an attempt to populate flight options quickly, SearchDirectFlight is executed without a status check, pulling in flights regardless of their status. This breach indicates non-compliance as 'delayed' or 'flying' status flights appear in the results.",
                "During a search request, the SearchDirectFlight tool was invoked to list options without filtering based on flight status, and consequently, included flights scheduled as 'delayed'. This use is non-compliant with policy stipulations.",
                "Attempting to utilize SearchDirectFlight to retrieve information for a flight with a status of 'on time' due to an oversight in pre-search filtering. This breach occurs because 'on time' flights are not compliant with the policy for direct search.",
                "A user inadvertently requests a flight search with SearchDirectFlight that includes a leg with a 'delayed' status due to inadequate data preprocessing, contravening the established policy.",
                "Execution of SearchDirectFlight occurs without ensuring all eligible flights are not in 'flying' status, inadvertently prompting a search on non-compliant flight data, thus violating policy constraints."

                "Before using SearchDirectFlight, the user's request is validated against current flight statuses, filtering out any flights that are 'delayed', 'on time', or 'flying'. Only 'available' flights, which comply with policy constraints, are considered.",
                "The flight search is initiated using SearchDirectFlight only after confirming through a preliminary check using another tool that the selected flights are marked as 'available', ensuring strict adherence to the policy guidelines.",
                "The agent uses SearchDirectFlight to find flights, ensuring that flights listed as 'delayed', 'on time', or 'flying' are excluded from the search beforehand. This preemptive measure guarantees compliance with the policy requirements.",
                "Prior to executing SearchDirectFlight, a script checks each flight's status to ensure 'available' capacity and ensures they haven't taken off. This meticulous approach reflects strict adherence to policy mandates.",
                "SearchDirectFlight execution is preceded by a confirmatory step using get_reservation_details.py to verify that all potential flights have the 'available' status, aligning with compliance standards.",
                "The agent conducts a pre-check using list_all_airports.py to confirm the details of available flights before engaging SearchDirectFlight, ensuring only flights meeting policy guidelines are searched.",

                "An agent meticulously verifies flight attributes with the flight status confirmed as 'available' before SearchDirectFlight is harnessed, ensuring compliance with policy obligations requiring checks for seat and price availability.",
                "Before calling SearchDirectFlight, the agent confirms through list_all_airports.py that desired flights are classified as 'available', thus maintaining compliance by ensuring only bookable flights are considered in the search."
