It is broad since it applies to all tools, not specifically tailored to BookReservation, but it can be enforced and compliance can be validated by observing interaction patterns and ensuring the agent only makes one tool call at a time. The policy's description is clear, providing actionable guidelines without needing additional context. \n\nScore: 4. The policy is clear and enforceable, but it would benefit from a mention of practical ways to monitor tool usage and enforcement for further context.\nThe policy is relevant as it applies to all tools, including ToolX (BookReservation). However, it is not tool-specific as it is a general rule applicable to the execution of any tool. Compliance can be validated by ensuring that only a single tool call is made at any given time, with no simultaneous user responses or additional tool calls, making it actionable. The policy is clear and self-contained, requiring no additional context.\nThe policy is relevant to ToolX since it pertains to how the agent should handle tool calls which include booking reservations. However, it isn't specific to ToolX as it speaks collectively to all tool calls made by the agent. The policy cannot be validated since it's about operational efficiency rather than a concrete rule that can be checked before using the tool. Although important to follow, compliance with this directive cannot be confirmed by the system beforehand. The policy's instruction does not rely on user data or chat history, making it non-actionable because it does not directly relate to ToolX's parameters or outcomes. Hence, the description isn't entirely self-contained as it needs specifications of what actions the policy prevents beyond tool call timing, especially for ToolX's context. Improved clarity and direct reference to ToolX-specific actions could make it more precise and actionable.\n"
