            "comments": "The 'Refund Timeline Policy' is relevant to the CancelReservation tool as it specifies the timeline for refunds, which occurs after a reservation cancellation. While the policy outlines key information related to refund timelines, it doesn't provide actionable steps or require validation prior to using the CancelReservation tool. It operates under assumptions that the financial processing will logically follow the invocation of the cancellation action, handled by backend processes beyond the tool's scope. The policy is self-contained, providing a clear description without the need for additional context from other documents.\nThe policy is relevant to the 'CancelReservation' tool, as it pertains to the processing timeline of refunds after a reservation cancellation, which the tool handles. It is specific to this tool's function of cancellation, thus making it tool-specific. However, the policy is not directly actionable, as the refund processing timeline after cancellation is an internal process handled by the payment system, not something within the control of the tool's invocation or use. Similarly, validation of this policy cannot occur beforehand as it requires post-cancellation processing outside the tool's operations, leaving it un-actionable from a tool-controlled perspective. The description is clear and concise, providing all necessary information, thus it is self-contained. Overall, given its clear relevance and necessity in understanding the timeline of fund processing post-cancellation, I would rate it as a 3. It lacks necessary actionable steps, not lending itself to modifications that would make it enforceable through the tool alone.\nThe 'Refund Timeline Policy' is relevant to the CancelReservation tool as refunds are typically associated with cancellations. However, the policy is not actionable or tool-specific because it is a guideline for refund processing timelines rather than an instruction for tool usage. Since the timeline for refunds cannot be verified or influenced through the CancelReservation tool, it cannot be validated before using the tool either. The policy description is self-contained, providing a clear statement on the refund timeline, requiring no further context from the policy document.\nThe policy is relevant to the CancelReservation tool as it specifies the timeline for refunds, which is part of the cancellation process. It is tool-specific because refunds are mentioned in the context of canceling a reservation, which is the functionality of ToolX. However, the policy cannot be validated before using the tool, as it involves a temporal process that takes place after the tool is used. It's not actionable with ToolX alone since ToolX's parameters, chat history, or data access do not affect or alter the refund timeline. The policy is self-contained as it clearly states the refund timeline without requiring additional context.\nThe policy is relevant to ToolX as it relates to the process of handling reservations, which is part of cancellation procedures involving ToolX. It is tool-specific because it applies specifically to the processes involving refund timelines for cancellations, potentially overseen using ToolX. Compliance with this policy can be validated before invoking ToolX based on the rules applicable to refunds once a cancellation is initiated. However, it is not actionable solely through ToolX since the refund timeline is a result of cancellation, but ToolX does not handle or enforce payment processing timelines directly. The policy is self-contained as it provides complete information regarding the refund timeline without needing additional context.\n"
