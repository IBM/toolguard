However, it is not specific to ToolX ('update_reservation_passengers') since it is applicable to all tools when invoked. Compliance with this policy can be validated before tool invocation by ensuring no simultaneous action is queued or response is generated. The policy is both actionable and self-contained as it requires no additional information to implement and comply with.\nThe policy is somewhat relevant as it applies to the target tool, 'update_reservation_passengers,' which is presumably part of a broader suite of tools. However, it is not specifically tailored to ToolX as it broadly applies to all tools, rather than directly addressing the functionalities specific to 'update_reservation_passengers.' The policy can be validated before invoking the tool, as agents can ensure they're making one tool call at a time and not responding simultaneously. It is actionable using ToolX's parameters and chat history, as compliance requires procedural adherence rather than capabilities inherent to the tool. The policy description is clear and complete without requiring further context, earning it a decent score despite the lack of specificity.\nThe policy is more general and not specific to ToolX, 'update_reservation_passengers'. It broadly applies to the agent's behavior irrespective of the tool being used. While it can be validated before invoking a tool, the policy does not uniquely apply to 'update_reservation_passengers'. Thus, it is not relevant in the context of ToolX. The description is clear and actionable within the context. The scoring takes into account its general nature, but since it does not specifically address any functionality or constraints of ToolX, it affects its relevance.\n"}]}
