async def improve_tool_guard(prev_impl: PythonCodeModel, domain: Domain, policy_item: ToolPolicyItem, dependent_tool_names: Set[str], review_comments: List[str])-> PythonCodeModel:
    """
    Improve the previous tool-call guard implementation (in Python) to cover all tool policy-items according to the review-comments.

    Args:
        prev_impl (PythonCodeModel): previous implementation of the tool-call check.
        domain (Domain): Python code defining available data types and other tool interfaces.
        policy_item (ToolPolicyItem): Requirements for this tool.
        dependent_tool_names (Set[str]): other tool names that this tool depends on.
        review_comments (List[str]): Review comments on the current implementation. For example, pylint errors or Failed unit-tests.

    Returns:
        PythonCodeModel: Improved implementation of the tool-call check.

    **Implementation Rules:**"
    - Never change the function signature. Never change the function parameters' names or type annotation.
    - ALL policy items must be checked.
    - The code should be simple.
    - The code should be well documented.
    - You should just validate the tool-call arguments. You should never call the tool itself.
    - If needed, you may use the functions listed in `dependent_tool_names` to call the `api` interface to get required information from the backend.
    - If needed to check information in the previous chat messages, you may use the `history` object.
    - `History.ask_bool(question)` function is slow and expensive. 
        - `History.ask_bool(question)` function use an LLM to answer natural language questions on messages in the past conversation .
        - Prefer using the API functions to get data, over history services.

    **Example: ** 
prev_impl = ```python
from typing import *
from rt_toolguard.data_types import ChatHistory
from airline.airline_types import *
from airline.i_airline import I_Airline

def guard_Checked_Bag_Allowance_by_Membership_Tier(history: ChatHistory, api: I_Airline, user_id: str, passengers: list[Passenger]):
    \"\"\"
    Limit to five passengers per reservation.
    \"\"\"
    pass #FIXME
```

should return something like:
```python
from typing import *
from rt_toolguard.data_types import ChatHistory
from airline.airline_types import *
from airline.i_airline import I_Airline

def guard_Checked_Bag_Allowance_by_Membership_Tier(history: ChatHistory, api: I_Airline, user_id: str, passengers: list[Passenger]):
    \"\"\"
    Limit to five passengers per reservation.
    \"\"\"
    if len(passengers) > 5:
        raise PolicyViolationException("More than five passengers are not allowed.")
```
