async def tool_information_dependencies(tool_name: str, policy: str, domain: FileTwin)-> Set[str]:
    """
    Lists other tools that the given tool depends on.

    Args:
        tool_name (str): name of the tool under analysis
        policy (str): business policy, in natural language, specifying a constraint on a business processes involving the tool unedr analysis
        domain (FileTwin): Python code defining available data types and other tool interfaces

    Returns:
        Set[str]: dependent tool names

    **Dependency Rules:**
    - Tool available information is: from it function arguments, or from calling other tools.
    - The function analyzes information dependency only on other tools.
    - Information dependency can be only on tools that are immutable. That is, that retieve data only, but do not modify the environment.
    - A dependency in another-tool exists only if the policy mention information is not available in the arguments, but can accessed by calling the other tool.
    - The set of dependencies can be empty, with one, or multiple tools.
